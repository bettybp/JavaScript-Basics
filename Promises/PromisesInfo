A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, 
or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved.
Anything that need to wait for promise to proceed, you put that in .then(..)
Promises help us to escape the callback hell.
Callback is just a function you call when you get the return result.
